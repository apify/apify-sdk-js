# Contributing

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Submission guidelines

### Submitting an issue

Before you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker, maybe an issue for your problem already exists, and the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available.

Please provide steps to reproduce if you found a bug or ideally fork the repository and add a failing test that demonstrates what is wrong. This will help us understand and fix the issue faster.

### Submitting a pull request

Before you submit your pull request, consider the following guidelines:

- Search [GitHub](https://github.com/apify/apify-sdk-js/pulls) for an open or closed PR that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.

- Fork the project and install NPM dependencies.

- Run tests before you start working, to be sure they all pass and your setup is working correctly:

    ```sh
    npm run test
    ```

- Be sure to **include appropriate test cases**. Tests help make it clear what the PR is fixing and also make sure the changes won't break over time.
- Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows defined [commit message conventions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QrDFcIiPjSLDn3EL15IJygNPiHORgU1_OOAqWjiDU5Y/edit#heading=h.uyo6cb12dt6w). Adherence to these conventions is necessary because release notes are automatically generated from these messages.
- Push the code to your forked repository and create a pull request on GitHub.
- If somebody from project contributors suggests changes:
    - Make the required updates.
    - Re-run all test suites to ensure tests are still passing.
    - Commit them and push. Don't rebase after you get a review, so it is clear what changes you did in the last commit. The PR will be squash merged, so its history is irrelevant.

That's it! Thank you for your contribution!

## Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at support@apify.com. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
