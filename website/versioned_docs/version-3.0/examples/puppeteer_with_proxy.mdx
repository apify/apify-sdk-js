FIXME: is this staying?

:::

This example demonstrates how to load pages in headless Chrome / Puppeteer over [Apify Proxy](https://docs.apify.com/proxy).

To make it work, you'll need an Apify account with access to the proxy. Visit the [Apify platform introduction](/docs/guides/apify-platform) to find
how to log into your account from the SDK.

:::tip

To run this example on the Apify Platform, select the `apify/actor-node-puppeteer-chrome` image for your Dockerfile.
