Stealth mode allows you to bypass anti-scraping techniques that use
[browser fingerprinting](https://pixelprivacy.com/resources/browser-fingerprinting/). It overrides the attributes specified for
[headless](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/headless-chrome) browser mode, making your headless browser harder to distinguish from
the full Chrome browser.

To activate stealth mode, you need to turn `useChrome` on, run `headless` and turn `stealth` on in your <ApiLink to="puppeteer-crawler/interface/PuppeteerCrawlerOptions#launchContext">`launchContext`</ApiLink>.

```js
const launchContext = {
    useChrome: true,
    stealth: true,
    launchOptions: {
        headless: true,
    },
};
```

<CodeBlock className="language-js">
	{CrawlSource}
</CodeBlock>

You can then specify the <ApiLink to="puppeteer-crawler/namespace/puppeteerStealth#StealthOptions">`stealthOptions`</ApiLink> you want,
which allow you to adapt to different anti-scraping techniques. All the options are set to `true` by default. The number of options does not affect performance.

While the default configuration will be fine in many cases, you can adapt the options to your use case.

### Single-browser instances

You can also use stealth mode in single-browser instances when using <ApiLink to="puppeteer-crawler/function/launchPuppeteer">`launchPuppeteer`</ApiLink>.
The `launchContext` is the same.
