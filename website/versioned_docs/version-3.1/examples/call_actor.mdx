This example demonstrates how to start an Apify Actor using
[`Actor.call()`](/reference/class/Actor#call) and how to call the Apify API using
[`Actor.newClient()`](/reference/class/Actor#newClient).
The script gets a random weird word and its explanation from [randomword.com](https://randomword.com/)
and sends it to your email using the [`apify/send-mail`](https://apify.com/apify/send-mail) Actor.

To make the example work, you'll need an [Apify account](https://console.apify.com/).
Go to the [Settings - Integrations](https://console.apify.com/account?tab=integrations) page to obtain your API token
and set it to the [`APIFY_TOKEN`](/docs/guides/environment-variables#APIFY_TOKEN) environment variable,
or run the script using the Apify CLI. If you deploy this Actor to the Apify Cloud, you can do things like set
up a scheduler to run your Actor early in the morning.

To see what other Actors are available, visit the [Apify Store](https://apify.com/store).

> To run this example on Apify Platform, use the `apify/actor-node-puppeteer-chrome` image for your Dockerfile.

```javascript
import { Actor } from 'apify';
import { launchPuppeteer } from 'crawlee';

await Actor.init();

// Launch the web browser.
const browser = await launchPuppeteer();

console.log('Obtaining own email address...');
const apifyClient = Actor.newClient();
const { email } = await apifyClient.user().get();

// Load randomword.com and get a random word
console.log('Fetching a random word.');
const page = await browser.newPage();
await page.goto('https://randomword.com/');
const randomWord = await page.$eval('#shared_section', (el) => el.outerHTML);

// Send random word to your email. For that, you can use an Actor we already
// have available on the platform under the name: apify/send-mail.
// The second parameter to the Actor.call() invocation is the Actor's
// desired input. You can find the required input parameters by checking
// the Actor's documentation page: https://apify.com/apify/send-mail
console.log(`Sending email to ${user.email}...`);
await Actor.call('apify/send-mail', {
    to: email,
    subject: 'Random Word',
    html: `<h1>Random Word</h1>${randomWord}`,
});
console.log('Email sent. Good luck!');

// Close Browser
await browser.close();

await Actor.exit();
```
