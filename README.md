Actor SDK is the core set of tools and utilities that we've built to help make your interaction with the [Apify Platform](https://apify.com) easier.
This monorepository holds all the components and tools that we've created for it!

## Actor SDK

The Actor SDK provides the tools required to run your own Apify Actors! Previously known as the Apify SDK, the crawlers part has been split into
a brand new module - [`crawlee`](https://npmjs.org/crawlee) (which you can use outside of Apify too!), while keeping the Apify specific parts in this module!
