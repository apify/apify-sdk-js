import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import ApiLink from '@site/src/components/ApiLink';
import { CrawleeApiLink } from '@site/src/components/CrawleeLinks';
import CrawlSource from '!!raw-loader!roa-loader!./puppeteer_crawler.ts';

This example demonstrates how to use <CrawleeApiLink to="puppeteer-crawler/class/PuppeteerCrawler">`PuppeteerCrawler`</CrawleeApiLink> in combination
with <ApiLink to="apify/class/RequestQueue">`RequestQueue`</ApiLink>
to recursively scrape the [Hacker News website](https://news.ycombinator.com) using headless Chrome / Puppeteer.

The crawler starts with a single URL, finds links to next pages, enqueues them and continues until no more desired links are available. The results
are stored to the default dataset. In local configuration, the results are stored as JSON files in `./storage/datasets/default`

:::tip

To run this example on the Apify Platform, select the `apify/actor-node-puppeteer-chrome` image for your Dockerfile.
