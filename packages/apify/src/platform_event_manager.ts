/**
 * Gets an instance of a Node.js'
 * [EventEmitter](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_class_eventemitter)
 * class that emits various events from the SDK or the Apify platform.
 * The event emitter is initialized by calling the {@apilink Actor.main} function.
 *
 * **Example usage:**
 *
 * ```javascript
 * Actor.on('cpuInfo', (data) => {
 *   if (data.isCpuOverloaded) console.log('Oh no, the CPU is overloaded!');
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * The following events are emitted:
 *
 * - `cpuInfo`: `{ "isCpuOverloaded": Boolean }`
 *   The event is emitted approximately every second
 *   and it indicates whether the actor is using the maximum of available CPU resources.
 *   If that's the case, the actor should not add more workload.
 *   For example, this event is used by the {@apilink AutoscaledPool} class.
 * - `migrating`: `void`
 *   Emitted when the actor running on the Apify platform is going to be migrated to another worker server soon.
 *   You can use it to persist the state of the actor and gracefully stop your in-progress tasks,
 *   so that they are not interrupted by the migration.
 *   For example, this is used by the {@apilink RequestList} class.
 * - `aborting`: `void`
 *   When a user aborts an actor run on the Apify platform, they can choose to abort gracefully to allow
 *   the actor some time before getting killed. This graceful abort emits the `aborting` event which the SDK
 *   uses to gracefully stop running crawls and you can use it to do your own cleanup as well.
 * - `persistState`: `{ "isMigrating": Boolean }`
 *   Emitted in regular intervals (by default 60 seconds) to notify all components of Apify SDK that it is time to persist
 *   their state, in order to avoid repeating all work when the actor restarts.
 *   This event is automatically emitted together with the `migrating` event,
 *   in which case the `isMigrating` flag is set to `true`. Otherwise the flag is `false`.
 *   Note that the `persistState` event is provided merely for user convenience,
 *   you can achieve the same effect using `setInterval()` and listening for the `migrating` event.
