Web Scraper is a generic easy-to-use Actor for crawling arbitrary web pages
and extracting structured data from them using a few lines of JavaScript code.
The Actor loads web pages in the Chromium browser and renders dynamic content.
Web Scraper can either be configured and run manually in a user interface, or programmatically using the API.
The extracted data is stored in a dataset, from where it can be exported to various formats,
such as JSON, XML, or CSV.

If you're not familiar with web scraping or front-end web development in general,
you might prefer to start with [**Web Scraping 101**](https://docs.apify.com/web-scraping-101) in Apify documentation,
and then continue with [**Scraping with Web Scraper**](https://docs.apify.com/tutorials/apify-scrapers/web-scraper),
a tutorial which will walk you through all the steps and provide a number of examples. Or you can just watch this video tutorial:

## Cost of usage
You can find the average usage cost for this Actor on the [pricing page](https://apify.com/pricing) under the `Which plan do I need?` section. Cheerio Scraper is equivalent to `Simple HTML pages` while Web Scraper, Puppeteer Scraper and Playwright Scraper are equivalent to `Full web pages`. These cost estimates are based on averages and might be lower or higher depending on how heavy the pages you scrape are.

## Usage

To get started with Web Scraper,
you only need two things. First, tell the scraper which web pages
it should load, and second, tell it how to extract data from each of the pages.

The scraper starts by loading pages specified in
the [**Start URLs**](#start-urls) input setting.
You can make the scraper follow page links on the fly
setting a [**Link selector**](#link-selector),
**[Glob Patterns](#glob-patterns)** and/or **[Pseudo-URLs](#pseudo-urls)**
to tell the scraper which links it should add to the crawling queue.
This is useful for the recursive crawling of entire websites,
e.g. to find all products in an online store.

To tell the scraper how to extract data from web pages,
you need to provide a [**Page function**](#page-function).
This is JavaScript code that is executed in the context
of every web page loaded.
Since the scraper uses the full-featured Chromium browser,
writing Page function
is equivalent to developing a front-end code,
and you can use client-side libraries such as
<a href="http://jquery.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jQuery</a>.

In summary, Web Scraper works as follows:

1. Adds each [Start URL](#start-urls) to the crawling queue.
2. Fetches the first URL from the queue and load it in Chromium browser.
3. Executes the [**Page function**](#page-function) on the loaded page and saves its results.
4. Optionally, finds all links from the page using the [**Link selector**](#link-selector).
   If a link matches any of the **[Glob Patterns](#glob-patterns)** and/or **[Pseudo-URLs](#pseudo-urls)** and has not yet been visited, adds it to the queue.
5. If there are more items in the queue, repeats step 2, otherwise finishes.

Web Scraper has a number of other configuration settings
to improve performance, set cookies for login to websites, etc.
See [Input configuration](#input-configuration) below
for the complete list of settings.

## Limitations

Web Scraper is designed to be generic and easy to use,
and as such might not be an ideal solution if your primary concern
is performance or flexibility.

The Actor employs a full-featured Chromium web browser,
which is resource-intensive and might be an overkill
for websites that do not render the content dynamically
using client-side JavaScript.
To achieve better performance for scraping such sites,
you might prefer to use
[**Cheerio Scraper**](https://apify.com/apify/cheerio-scraper) (`apify/cheerio-scraper`),
which downloads and processes raw HTML pages without the overheads of
a full web browser.

Since Web Scraper's **Page function** is executed in the context
of the web page, it only supports client-side JavaScript code.
If you need to use some server-side libraries or have more control
of the Chromium browser using the underlying
[Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer) library,
you might prefer to use
[**Puppeteer Scraper**](https://apify.com/apify/puppeteer-scraper) (`apify/puppeteer-scraper`).
If you prefer [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright), check out
[**Playwright Scraper**](https://apify.com/apify/playwright-scraper) (`apify/playwright-scraper`).
For even more flexibility and control, you might develop
a new Actor from scratch in Node.js using [Apify SDK](https://sdk.apify.com/) and [Crawlee](https://crawlee.dev).

## Input configuration

On input, the Web Scraper Actor accepts a number of configuration settings.
These can be entered either manually in the user interface in [Apify Console](https://console.apify.com),
or programmatically in a JSON object using the [Apify API](https://docs.apify.com/api/v2#/reference/actors/run-collection/run-actor).
For a complete list of input fields and their type, please see [Input](https://apify.com/apify/web-scraper/input-schema).

### Run mode

Run mode allows you to switch between two modes of operation for Web Scraper.

**PRODUCTION** mode gives you full control and full performance. You should always
switch Web Scraper to production mode once you're done making changes to your scraper.

When starting to develop your Scraper, you want to be able to inspect what's happening
in the browser and debug your code. You can do that with the scraper's **DEVELOPMENT**
mode. It allows you to directly control the browser using Chrome DevTools.
Open the Live View tab to access the DevTools. It will also limit concurrency and
prevent timeouts to improve your DevTools experience. Other debugging related options
can be configured in the **Advanced configuration** section.

### Start URLs

The **Start URLs** (`startUrls`) field represent the initial list of URLs
of pages that the scraper will visit.
You can either enter these URLs manually one by one, upload them in a CSV file or
[link URLs from the Google Sheets](https://help.apify.com/en/articles/2906022-scraping-a-list-of-urls-from-a-google-sheets-document)
document.
Each URL must start with either a `http://` or `https://` protocol prefix.

The scraper supports adding new URLs to scrape on the fly, either using the
**[Link selector](#link-selector)** and **[Glob Patterns](#glob-patterns)**/**[Pseudo-URLs](#pseudo-urls)** options
or by calling <code>await context.enqueueRequest()</code>
inside [**Page function**](#page-function).

Optionally, each URL can be associated with custom user data - a JSON object that can be referenced from
your JavaScript code in [**Page function**](#page-function) under `context.request.userData`.
This is useful for determining which start URL is currently loaded,
in order to perform some page-specific actions.
For example, when crawling an online store, you might want to perform different
actions on a page listing the products vs. a product detail page.
For details, see [**Web scraping tutorial**](https://docs.apify.com/tutorials/apify-scrapers/getting-started#the-start-url)
in Apify documentation.

<!-- TODO: Describe how the queue works, unique key etc. plus link -->

### Link selector

The **Link selector** (`linkSelector`) field contains a CSS selector that is used to find links to other web pages,
i.e. `<a>` elements with the `href` attribute.

On every page loaded, the scraper looks for all links matching **Link selector**,
checks that the target URL matches one of the [**Glob Patterns**](#glob-patterns)/[**Pseudo-URLs**](#pseudo-urls),
and if so then adds the URL to the request queue, so that it's loaded by the scraper later.

By default, new scrapers are created with the following selector that matches all links:

```
a[href]
```

If <b>Link selector</b> is empty, the page links are ignored,
and the scraper only loads pages that were specified in [**Start URLs**](#start-urls)
or that were manually added to the request queue by calling <code>await context.enqueueRequest()</code>
in [**Page function**](#page-function).

### Glob Patterns

The **Glob Patterns** (`globs`) field specifies which types of URLs found by **[Link selector](#link-selector)** should be added to the request queue.

A glob pattern is simply a string with wildcard characters.

For example, a glob pattern `http://www.example.com/pages/**/*` will match all the
following URLs:

-   `http://www.example.com/pages/deeper-level/page`
-   `http://www.example.com/pages/my-awesome-page`
-   `http://www.example.com/pages/something`

Note that you don't need to use the **Glob Patterns** setting at all, because you can completely control which pages the scraper will access by calling `await context.enqueueRequest()` from the **[Page function](#page-function)**.

### Pseudo-URLs

The **Pseudo-URLs** (`pseudoUrls`) field specifies
what kind of URLs found by [**Link selector**](#link-selector) should be added to the request queue.

A pseudo-URL is simply a URL with special directives enclosed in `[]` brackets.
Currently, the only supported directive is `[regexp]`, which defines
a JavaScript-style regular expression to match against the URL.

For example, a pseudo-URL `http://www.example.com/pages/[(\w|-)*]` will match all the
following URLs:

-   `http://www.example.com/pages/`
-   `http://www.example.com/pages/my-awesome-page`
-   `http://www.example.com/pages/something`

If either `[` or `]` is part of the normal query string,
it must be encoded as `[\x5B]` or `[\x5D]`, respectively. For example,
the following pseudo-URL:

```
http://www.example.com/search?do[\x5B]load[\x5D]=1
```

will match the URL:

```
http://www.example.com/search?do[load]=1
```

Optionally, each pseudo-URL can be associated with user data
that can be referenced from
your [**Page function**](#page-function) using `context.request.label`
to determine which kind of page is currently loaded in the browser.

Note that you don't need to use the **Pseudo-URLs** setting at all,
because you can completely control which pages the scraper will access
by calling `await context.enqueueRequest()` from [**Page function**](#page-function).

### Page function

The **Page function** (`pageFunction`) field
contains a JavaScript function that is executed in the context
of every page loaded in the Chromium browser.
The purpose of this function is to extract
data from the web page, manipulate the DOM by clicking elements,
add new URLs to the request queue
and otherwise control Web Scraper's operation.

Example:

```javascript
async function pageFunction(context) {
    // jQuery is handy for finding DOM elements and extracting data from them.
    // To use it, make sure to enable the "Inject jQuery" option.
    const $ = context.jQuery;
    const pageTitle = $('title').first().text();

    // Print some information to Actor log
    context.log.info(`URL: ${context.request.url}, TITLE: ${pageTitle}`);

    // Manually add a new page to the scraping queue.
    await context.enqueueRequest({ url: 'http://www.example.com' });

    // Return an object with the data extracted from the page.
    // It will be stored to the resulting dataset.
    return {
        url: context.request.url,
        pageTitle,
    };
}
```

The page function accepts a single argument, the `context` object,
whose properties are listed in the table below.
Since the function is executed in the context of the web page, it can access the DOM,
e.g. using the `window` or `document` global variables.

The return value of the page function is an object (or an array of objects) representing the data extracted from the web page.
The return value must be stringify-able to JSON, i.e. it can only contain basic types and no circular references.
If you don't want to extract any data from the page and skip it in the clean results, simply return `null` or `undefined`.

The page function supports the JavaScript ES6 syntax and is asynchronous, which means you can use the <code>await</code>
keyword to wait for background operations to finish.
To learn more about `async` functions,
see <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function">Mozilla documentation</a>.

**Properties of the `context` object:**

-   ##### **`customData: Object`**

    Contains the object provided in the **Custom data** (`customData`) input setting.
    This is useful for passing dynamic parameters to your Web Scraper using API.

-   ##### **`enqueueRequest(request, [options]): AsyncFunction`**

    Adds a new URL to the request queue, if it wasn't already there.
    The `request` parameter is an object containing details of the request,
    with properties such as `url`, `label`, `userData`, `headers` etc.
    For the full list of the supported properties, see the
    <a href="https://crawlee.dev/api/core/class/Request" target="_blank"><code>Request</code></a> object's constructor in Crawlee documentation.

    The optional `options` parameter is an object with additional options.
    Currently, it only supports the `forefront` boolean flag. If it's `true`,
    the request is added to the beginning of the queue. By default, requests are added to the end.

    Example:

    ```javascript
    await context.enqueueRequest({ url: 'https://www.example.com' });
    await context.enqueueRequest({ url: 'https://www.example.com/first' }, { forefront: true });
    ```

-   ##### **`env: Object`**

    A map of all relevant values set by the Apify platform to the Actor run
    via the `APIFY_` environment variables.
    For example, you can find here information such as Actor run ID, timeouts, Actor run memory, etc.
    For the full list of available values, see
    <a href="https://sdk.apify.com/api/apify/interface/ApifyEnv" target="_blank"><code>ApifyEnv</code></a>
    interface in Apify SDK.

    Example:

    ```javascript
    console.log(`Actor run ID: ${context.env.actorRunId}`);
    ```

-   ##### **`getValue(key): AsyncFunction`**

    Gets a value from the default key-value store associated with the Actor run.
    The key-value store is useful for persisting named data records, such as state objects, files, etc.
    The function is very similar to <a href="https://sdk.apify.com/api/apify/class/Actor#getValue" target="_blank"><code>Actor.getValue()</code></a>
    function in Apify SDK.

    To set the value, use the dual function `context.setValue(key, value)`.

    Example:

    ```javascript
    const value = await context.getValue('my-key');
    console.dir(value);
    ```

-   ##### **`globalStore: Object`**

    Represents an in-memory store that can be used to share data across page function invocations,
    e.g. state variables, API responses or other data.
    The `globalStore` object has an equivalent interface as JavaScript's
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map" target="_blank"><code>Map</code></a> object,
    with a few important differences:

    -   All functions of `globalStore` are `async`; use `await` when calling them.
    -   Keys must be strings and values need to be JSON stringify-able.
    -   `forEach()` function is not supported.

    Note that the stored data is not persisted. If the Actor run is restarted or migrated to another worker server,
    the content of `globalStore` is reset. Therefore, never depend on a specific value to be present
    in the store.

    Example:

    ```javascript
    let movies = await context.globalStore.get('cached-movies');
    if (!movies) {
        movies = await fetch('http://example.com/movies.json');
        await context.globalStore.set('cached-movies', movies);
    }
    console.dir(movies);
    ```

-   ##### **`input: Object`**

    An object containing the Actor run input, i.e. the Web Scraper's configuration.
    Each page function invocation gets a fresh
    copy of the `input` object, so changing its properties has no effect.

-   ##### **`jQuery: Function`**

    A reference to the <a href="https://api.jquery.com/" target="_blank"><code>jQuery</code></a> library,
    which is extremely useful for DOM traversing, manipulation, querying and data extraction.
    This field is only available if the **Inject jQuery** option is enabled.

    Typically, the jQuery function is registered under a global variable called <code>$</code>.
    However, the web page might use this global variable for something else.
    To avoid conflicts, the jQuery object is not registered globally
    and is only available through the `context.jQuery` property.

    Example:

    ```javascript
    const $ = context.jQuery;
    const pageTitle = $('title').first().text();
    ```

-   ##### **`log: Object`**

    An object containing logging functions,
    with the same interface as provided by the
    <a href="https://crawlee.dev/api/core/class/Log" target="_blank"><code>Crawlee.utils.log</code></a>
    object in Crawlee.
    The log messages are written directly to the Actor run log, which is useful for monitoring and debugging.
    Note that <code>log.debug()</code> only prints messages to the log
    if the **Enable debug log** input setting is set.

    Example:

    ```javascript
    const log = context.log;
    log.debug('Debug message', { hello: 'world!' });
    log.info('Information message', { all: 'good' });
    log.warning('Warning message');
    log.error('Error message', { details: 'This is bad!' });
    try {
        throw new Error('Not good!');
    } catch (e) {
        log.exception(e, 'Exception occurred', { details: 'This is really bad!' });
    }
    ```

-   ##### **`request: Object`**

    An object containing information about the currently loaded web page,
    such as the URL, number of retries, a unique key, etc.
    Its properties are equivalent to the <a href="https://crawlee.dev/api/core/class/Request" target="_blank"><code>Request</code></a> object in Crawlee.

-   ##### **`response: Object`**

    An object containing information about the HTTP response from the web server.
    Currently, it only contains the `status` and `headers` properties.
    For example:

    ```javascript
    {
      // HTTP status code
      status: 200,

      // HTTP headers
      headers: {
        'content-type': 'text/html; charset=utf-8',
        'date': 'Wed, 06 Nov 2019 16:01:53 GMT',
        'cache-control': 'no-cache',
        'content-encoding': 'gzip',
      },
    }
    ```

-   ##### **`saveSnapshot(): AsyncFunction`**

    Saves a screenshot and full HTML of the current page to the key-value store
    associated with the Actor run,
    under the `SNAPSHOT-SCREENSHOT` and `SNAPSHOT-HTML` keys, respectively.
    This feature is useful when debugging your scraper.

    Note that each snapshot overwrites the previous one and the `saveSnapshot()`
    calls are throttled to at most one call in two seconds,
    in order to avoid excess consumption of resources and slowdown of the Actor.

-   ##### **`setValue(key, data, options): AsyncFunction`**

    Sets a value to the default key-value store associated with the Actor run.
    The key-value store is useful for persisting named data records, such as state objects, files, etc.
    The function is very similar to <a href="https://crawlee.dev/api/core/class/KeyValueStore#setValue" target="_blank"><code>KeyValueStore.setValue()</code></a>
    function in Crawlee.

    To get the value, use the dual function `await context.getValue(key)`.

    Example:

    ```javascript
    await context.setValue('my-key', { hello: 'world' });
    ```

-   ##### **`skipLinks(): AsyncFunction`**

    Calling this function ensures that page links from the current page
    will not be added to the request queue, even if they match the [**Link selector**](#link-selector)
    and/or [**Glob Patterns**](#glob-patterns)/[**Pseudo-URLs**](#pseudo-urls) settings.
    This is useful to programmatically stop recursive crawling,
    e.g. if you know there are no more interesting links on the current page to follow.

-   ##### **`waitFor(task, options): AsyncFunction`**

    A helper function that waits either a specific amount of time (in milliseconds),
    for an element specified using a CSS selector to appear in the DOM
    or for a provided function to return `true`.
    This is useful for extracting data from web pages with a dynamic content,
    where the content might not be available at the time when page function is called.

    The `options` parameter is an object with the following properties and default values:

    ```javascript
    {
      // Maximum time to wait
      timeoutMillis: 20000,

      // How often to check if the condition changes
      pollingIntervalMillis: 50,
    }
    ```

    Example:

    ```javascript
    // Wait for selector
    await context.waitFor('.foo');
    // Wait for 1 second
    await context.waitFor(1000);
    // Wait for predicate
    await context.waitFor(() => !!document.querySelector('.foo'), { timeoutMillis: 5000 });
    ```

## Proxy configuration

The **Proxy configuration** (`proxyConfiguration`) option enables you to set
proxies that will be used by the scraper in order to prevent its detection by target websites.
You can use both [Apify Proxy](https://apify.com/proxy)
and custom HTTP or SOCKS5 proxy servers.

Proxy is required to run the scraper. The following table lists the available options of the proxy configuration setting:

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <th><b>Apify&nbsp;Proxy&nbsp;(automatic)</b></td>
        <td>
            The scraper will load all web pages using <a href="https://apify.com/proxy">Apify Proxy</a>
            in the automatic mode. In this mode, the proxy uses all proxy groups
            that are available to the user, and for each new web page it automatically selects the proxy
            that hasn't been used in the longest time for the specific hostname,
            in order to reduce the chance of detection by the website.
            You can view the list of available proxy groups
            on the <a href="https://console.apify.com/proxy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proxy</a> page in Apify Console.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th><b>Apify&nbsp;Proxy&nbsp;(selected&nbsp;groups)</b></td>
        <td>
            The scraper will load all web pages using <a href="https://apify.com/proxy">Apify Proxy</a>
            with specific groups of target proxy servers.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th><b>Custom&nbsp;proxies</b></td>
        <td>
            <p>
            The scraper will use a custom list of proxy servers.
            The proxies must be specified in the <code>scheme://user:password@host:port</code> format,
            multiple proxies should be separated by a space or new line.
            The URL scheme can be either <code>http</code> or <code>socks5</code>.
            User and password might be omitted, but the port must always be present.
            </p>
            <p>
                Example:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-none">http://bob:password@proxy1.example.com:8000
http://bob:password@proxy2.example.com:8000</code></pre>
        </td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

The proxy configuration can be set programmatically when calling the Actor using the API
by setting the `proxyConfiguration` field.
It accepts a JSON object with the following structure:

```javascript
{
    // Indicates whether to use Apify Proxy or not.
    "useApifyProxy": Boolean,

    // Array of Apify Proxy groups, only used if "useApifyProxy" is true.
    // If missing or null, Apify Proxy will use the automatic mode.
    "apifyProxyGroups": String[],

    // Array of custom proxy URLs, in "scheme://user:password@host:port" format.
    // If missing or null, custom proxies are not used.
    "proxyUrls": String[],
}
```

### Logging into websites with Web Scraper

The **Initial cookies** field allows you to set cookies that will be used by the scraper to log into websites.
Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer by your web browser. Various websites use cookies to store information about your current session - by transferring this information to the scraper, it will be able to log into websites using your credentials. To learn more about logging into websites by transfering cookies, check out our [tutorial](https://docs.apify.com/tutorials/log-in-by-transferring-cookies).

Be aware that cookies usually have a limited lifetime and will expire after a certain period of time. This means that you will have to update the cookies periodically in order to keep the scraper logged in. Alternative approach is to make the scraper actively log in to the website in the Page function. For more info about this approach, check out our [tutorial](https://docs.apify.com/tutorials/log-into-a-website-using-puppeteer) on logging into websites using Puppeteer.

The scraper expects the cookies in the **Initial cookies** field to be stored as separate JSON objects in a JSON array, see example below:

```json
[
    {
        "name": " ga",
        "value": "GA1.1.689972112. 1627459041",
        "domain": ".apify.com",
        "hostOnly": false,
        "path": "/",
        "secure": false,
        "httpOnly": false,
        "sameSite": "no_restriction",
        "session": false,
        "firstPartyDomain": "",
        "expirationDate": 1695304183,
        "storelId": "firefox-default",
        "id": 1
    }
]
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Pre-navigation hooks

This is an array of functions that will be executed **BEFORE** the main `pageFunction` is run. A similar `context` object is passed into each of these functions as is passed into the `pageFunction`; however, a second "[DirectNavigationOptions](https://crawlee.dev/api/puppeteer-crawler/namespace/puppeteerUtils#DirectNavigationOptions)" object is also passed in.

The available options can be seen here:

```JavaScript
preNavigationHooks: [
    async ({ id, request, session, proxyInfo }, { timeout, waitUntil, referer }) => {}
]
```

> Unlike with playwright, puppeteer and cheerio scrapers, in web scraper we don't have the `Actor` (previously `Apify`) object available in the hook parameters, as the hook is executed inside the browser.

Check out the docs for [Pre-navigation hooks](https://crawlee.dev/api/puppeteer-crawler/interface/PuppeteerCrawlerOptions#preNavigationHooks) and the [PuppeteerHook type](https://crawlee.dev/api/puppeteer-crawler/interface/PuppeteerHook) for more info regarding the objects passed into these functions.

### Post-navigation hooks

An array of functions that will be executed **AFTER** the main `pageFunction` is run. The only available parameter is the `CrawlingContext` object.

```JavaScript
postNavigationHooks: [
    async ({ id, request, session, proxyInfo, response }) => {}

> Unlike with playwright, puppeteer and cheerio scrapers, in web scraper we don't have the `Actor` (previously `Apify`) object available in the hook parameters, as the hook is executed inside the browser.

Check out the docs for [Post-navigation hooks](https://crawlee.dev/api/puppeteer-crawler/interface/PuppeteerCrawlerOptions#postNavigationHooks) and the [PuppeteerHook type](https://crawlee.dev/api/puppeteer-crawler/interface/PuppeteerHook) for more info regarding the objects passed into these functions.

### Insert breakpoint

This property has no effect if [Run mode](#run-mode) is set to **PRODUCTION**. When set to **DEVELOPMENT** it inserts a breakpoint at the selected location in every page the scraper visits. Execution of code stops at the breakpoint until manually resumed in the DevTools window accessible via Live View tab or Container URL. Additional breakpoints can be added by adding debugger; statements within your Page function.

### Debug log

When set to true, debug messages will be included in the log. Use `context.log.debug('message')` to log your own debug messages.

### Browser log

When set to true, console messages from the browser will be included in the Actor's log. This may result in the log being flooded by error messages, warnings and other messages of little value (especially with a high concurrency).

### Custom data

Since the input UI is fixed, it does not support adding of other fields that may be needed for all specific use cases. If you need to pass arbitrary data to the scraper, use the [Custom data](#custom-data) input field within [Advanced configuration](#advanced-configuration) and its contents will be available under the `customData` context key as an object within the [pageFunction](#page-function).

### Custom namings

With the final three options in the **Advanced configuration**, you can set custom names for the following:

-   Dataset
-   Key-value store
-   Request queue

Leave the storage unnamed if you only want the data within it to be persisted on the Apify platform for a number of days corresponding to your [plan](https://apify.com/pricing) (after which it will expire). Named storages are retained indefinitely. Additionally, using a named storage allows you to share it across multiple runs (e.g. instead of having 10 different unnamed datasets for 10 different runs, all the data from all 10 runs can be accumulated into a single named dataset). Learn more [here](https://docs.apify.com/storage#named-and-unnamed-storages).

## Results

The scraping results returned by [**Page function**](#page-function)
are stored in the default dataset associated with the Actor run,
from where you can export them to formats such as JSON, XML, CSV or Excel.
For each object returned by [**Page function**](#page-function),
Web Scraper pushes one record into the dataset,
and extends it with metadata such as the URL of the web page where the results come from.

For example, if your page function returned the following object:

```js
{
    message: 'Hello world!';
}
```

The full object stored in the dataset will look as follows
(in JSON format, including the metadata fields `#error` and `#debug`):

```json
{
    "message": "Hello world!",
    "#error": false,
    "#debug": {
        "requestId": "fvwscO2UJLdr10B",
        "url": "https://www.example.com/",
        "loadedUrl": "https://www.example.com/",
        "method": "GET",
        "retryCount": 0,
        "errorMessages": null,
        "statusCode": 200
    }
}
```

To download the results, call the
[Get dataset items](https://docs.apify.com/api/v2#/reference/datasets/item-collection)
API endpoint:

```
https://api.apify.com/v2/datasets/[DATASET_ID]/items?format=json
```

where `[DATASET_ID]` is the ID of the Actor's run dataset,
in which you can find the Run object returned when starting the Actor.
Alternatively, you'll find the download links for the results in Apify Console.

To skip the `#error` and `#debug` metadata fields from the results
and not include empty result records,
simply add the `clean=true` query parameter to the API URL,
or select the **Clean items** option when downloading the dataset in Apify Console.

To get the results in other formats, set the `format` query parameter to `xml`, `xlsx`, `csv`, `html`, etc.
For more information, see [Datasets](https://apify.com/docs/storage#dataset) in documentation
or the [Get dataset items](https://docs.apify.com/api/v2#/reference/datasets/item-collection)
endpoint in Apify API reference.
