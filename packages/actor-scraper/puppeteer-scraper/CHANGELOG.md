- Added new options:
  - **Dismiss cookie modals** (`closeCookieModals`): Using the [I don't care about cookies](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/i-dont-care-about-cookies/) browser extension. When on, the crawler will automatically try to dismiss cookie consent modals. This can be useful when crawling European websites that show cookie consent modals.
    - **Maximum scrolling distance in pixels** (`maxScrollHeightPixels`): The crawler will scroll down the page until all content is loaded or the maximum scrolling distance is reached. Setting this to `0` disables scrolling altogether.
  - **Exclude Glob Patterns** (`excludes`): Glob patterns to match links in the page that you want to exclude from being enqueued.

## 3.0 (`version-3`)

- Rewrite from Apify SDK to Crawlee, see the [v3 migration guide](https://sdk.apify.com/docs/upgrading/upgrading-to-v3) for more details.
- Proxy usage is now required.

## 2.0 (`version-2`)

Main difference between v1 and v2 of the scrapers is the upgrade of SDK to v2, which requires node v15.10+. SDK v2 uses http2 to do the requests with cheerio-scraper, and the http2 support in older node versions were too buggy, so we decided to drop support for those. If you need to run on older node version, use SDK v1.

Please refer to the SDK 1.0 migration guide for more details about functional changes in the SDK. SDK v2 basically only changes the required node version and has no other breaking changes.

- deprecated `useRequestQueue` option has been removed
    - `RequestQueue` will be always used
- deprecated `context.html` getter from the `cheerio-scraper` has been removed
    - use `context.body` instead

    - `puppeteerPool` was replaced by `browserPool`
    - `autoscaledPool` and `browserPool` and available on the `crawler` property of `crawlingContext` object
- custom "Key-value store name" option in Advanced configuration is now fixed, previously the default store was always used
